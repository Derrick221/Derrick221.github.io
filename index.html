      <h1>All about, Derrick Flowers</h1>
    <p>Ever since i could remember, i have been interested in computers. One of my goals when it comes to computers is to be able to understand just about everything there is to know about them. I am currently taking a course in computer coding. In this class, the main thing i will be learning is building a website from scratch, and this class will open up many job opportunities for me when i am done, if don't get hired in right after. </p>

    <p>My main goal is to become one of the greatest boxers of all time. I have been training for a few years, and i am getting close. I have some of the fastest hands in my gym, and my coach sees a promising future in boxing for me. I train everyday, and push myself to be better than i was the day before. If i have a flaw, or anything i need to improve on, i do not give up until i am better. </p>

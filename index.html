      <h1>All about, Derrick Flowers</h1>
    <p>Ever since i could remember, i have been interested in computers. One of my goals when it comes to computers is to be able to understand just about everything there is to know about them. I am currently taking a course in computer coding. In this class, the main thing i will be learning is building a website from scratch, and this class will open up many job opportunities for me when i am done, if don't get hired in right after. </p>

    <p>My main goal is to become one of the greatest boxers of all time. I have been training for a few years, and i am getting close. I have some of the fastest hands in my gym, and my coach sees a promising future in boxing for me. I train everyday, and push myself to be better than i was the day before. If i have a flaw, or anything i need to improve on, i do not give up until i am better. </p>
    <P>I have always believed in striving to make myself better, to never stay in one place in my life. Always be better than yesterday, because you only get one life, so you should make the most of it. In the near furture i will be attending oakland community collage for technical engineering. The future is in computers, so I am getting a head start.A few of my qualities are I am had working, persistent, and ambitious. I like to look at myself as an perfectionist.</P>
